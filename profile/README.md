# Bottlerocket

Bottlerocket is a Linux-based operating system optimized for hosting containers.
Itâ€™s free and open-source software, developed in the open here on GitHub.
Bottlerocket is installed as the base operating system on the machine or instance where your containers themselves are running.
It is specifically designed to work with your container orchestrator (like Kubernetes) to automate the lifecycle of the containers running in your cluster.
Bottlerocket runs in the cloud or in your datacenter.
